# Finalyearproject
Engineering project on simulation of pitching airfoil at low frequencies. 
Files for boundary conditions- Velocity, pressure and turbulent conditions are included in the '0' folder.
Files relavant to computational time and courant number in the ControlDict file in the 'system' folder/directory. 
The 'constant' directory contains the files for meshing and transport/turbulent properties. 
The angle of attack can be varied by changing the initial velocity conditions.
The angular frequency is 0.157rad/s can be changed in the dynamicmeshdict.
